CHWs are community-based members who have been trained to deliver basic health services but who do not hold a professional health qualification. This being said, Kenya is estimated to have more than 82,000 CHW\u2019s as of 2021. Even though we have this number, the amount of work they have to do is very high considering the fact that the government doesn\u2019t compensate them. Achieving universal healthcare is one of the government's agenda and the CHW\u2019s see to it that it comes true yet they are not remunerated nor appreciated for the work they do. CHW\u2019s have to carry books and pens in order to document their findings. This brings in the issue of record-keeping, updating and authentication. Taking the example of visiting 5,000 homes, they have to have different books since they fill up quickly by the end of the month. When it's time to make calculations on their findings, it's difficult for them since data is scattered in different books. This is also a big problem especially when it comes to presenting this data. Books and papers are not a very reliable method of collecting data because they get damaged and lost easily. There are several materials that a community health worker should have when they go to their outreach: CHW Manual to provide the CHW with information needed to carry out the work and exercises to complete during training. A set of Counselling Cards which will guide the CHW during home visits and will also be shown to the families to help them understand the messages. Mother and Baby Card to be given to each family during the first pregnancy visit; it will continue to be used until the last home visit after the birth . Referral Note to be used when referring a family to the health facility After doing research we came up with a problem statement which was : How might we increase the efficiency of data collection by Community Health Workers for ease of tracking and presentation to stakeholders? Link to the Figma files Users Community Health Workers Organizations that engage Community Health Workers User Personas Organisations Admin Community Health Worker Product Features Home Page The home page will hold a list of households and a floating action button that will enable the community health worker to add a new household. Search Bar This will be on the home page and will enable the community health worker to search a household she/he wants to visit or follow up. They will be able to search using the household\u2019s contact person\u2019s first or last name. Bottom Navigation Bar The home page will have a navigation bar at the bottom that will enable the community health worker to move to other pages of the web application Filter- This feature will enable the community health worker to filter the households into visited, unvisited, or all. This will enable fast accessibility of the households. Referrals The application enables CHWs to refer patients to specific facilities in case their conditions can not be managed at home. The organization gets an alert about the referrals. Thereafter the patient's profile is updated to the follow-up interface for the CHW to keep in contact with them. Assessment Forms- The web application will have assessment forms that will hold questions that need to be filled in by the community health worker during the home visits. These forms will hold back and next buttons at the bottom of the page, and page numbers showing the community health worker which page they are in. Follow-ups The follow-up interface consists of the patients who were referred or whose conditions need a close follow-up. Calendar The Calendar is to enable the CHWs to schedule tasks and also get notified whenever the organizations schedule general tasks such as action days. Admin Dashboard The dashboard will only be accessed by the admins of the organizations. IT will show the performance of the community health workers in their specific regions, and the households they interact with. The admin will also be able to remove, add or edit a community health worker. The admin will also be able to save events for the community health worker like outreaches they need to attend to and days they need to send in their reports. It will also show the illnesses that have been recorded in the households and the number of patients suffering from certain illnesses. The dashboard will have a toggle button that enables one to switch between light and dark themes. Development Requirements Languages Python Javascript Html/CSS Bootstrap FrameWorks Django Django is an open-source framework for backend web applications based on Python. It is simple to use, flexible, reliable, and scalable. It has a big, supportive community accessed through numerous forums, channels, and dedicated websites. It\u2019s easy to find help when there\u2019s a problematic function in the code. Django has great documentation and it is maintained on a high level, updated with new functions and fixes so one can easily adapt to changes. Databases PostgreSQL Postgres allows you to store large and sophisticated data safely. It helps in building complex applications and running administrative tasks. It also regularly updates itself with new features. This database also enables interaction with other sources of data and its performance is much higher. FireBase Firebase apps remain responsive even when offline because the Firebase Realtime Database SDK persists your data to disk. Once connectivity is reestablished, the client device receives any changes it missed, synchronizing it with the current server state. Heroku Heroku is a platform as a service (Paas) that enables developers to build, run and operate applications entirely in the cloud. Heroku offers a free plan to experiment and find out what works best for you. Heroku is open and extensible so developers can build in whichever language we choose. It offers free application deployment, scaling, and management. Product Release Goals By the use of service workers, our progressive web app should be able to work offline and enable push notifications The database should be able to store all the information collected from the apps interface The users should be able to filter through different household categories such as visited and unvisited The PWA should be responsive across different devices Pending Issues Whether the community health worker should create their own account or be onboarded by the organization. If the community health worker is going to create their own password or use their unique identification number as the password. Development Plan We will be working as a group and everyone will have a task to do for the development to be complete. We will be using Zenhub as our product management tool and we will be having different scrum masters and product managers every week. Our QA will be our trainer James Mwai who will also be guiding us through the product development. We will be using Github as our version control software that will allow every member of the group to contribute to the project. All the tasks need to be done and completed on time for the smooth running of the development period.
